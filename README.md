# Laravel Bootstrap Validator

A collection of extra validation rules for the BootstrapValidator library (http://bootstrapvalidator.com) which mirror the rules available in the Laravel framework (http://laravel.com).

The goal of this collection is to make it easy for developers who use both Laravel and BootstrapValidator to have parity between server side and client side validation checks.
